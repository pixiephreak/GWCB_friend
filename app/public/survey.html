    <!-- Joel D. Anderson said on Twitter "...judging people on their politics is entirely appropriate. Politics is a vehicle through which they wish to shape the world."
    Would you like to:
    # find a friend who shares your politics
    # find someone who shares some of your political attitudes, but differs on others
    # find someone whose views differ significantly -->
