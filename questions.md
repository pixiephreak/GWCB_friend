Joel D. Anderson said on Twitter "...judging people on their politics is entirely appropriate. Politics is a vehicle through which they wish to shape the world."
Would you like to:
# find a friend who shares your politics
# find someone who shares some of your political attitudes, but differs on others
# find someone whose views differ significantly

1. Are you registered with a political party or would you be if you had the right to vote in the U.S.?

Yes, I'm a Republican.
Yes, I'm a Democrat.
Yes, I'm a third party voter.
No, democracy as a system has failed us on too many levels to participate.
None of the above come close to describing my views.

2. Do you:

Detest Donald Trump on political, ideological, and personal terms?
Think it's a shame that Trump was able to manipulate people's interest in order to gain power?
Support the policies and ideology of the Trump regime?
Don't really care about the office of the U.S. presidency?
None of the above come close to describing my views.

3. You think that:

Your nations borders should be closed to all immigrants and refugees.
Your nations border should be tightly controlled, but opened to refugees.
Your nations borders should be open, but clearly defined procedures for immigrating should be established and followed.
Borders are imaginary constructs that should not factor into where how people move through their world.
None of the above come close to describing my views.

4. Women:

Have the right to make any and all decisions regarding their personal health and should have explicitly protected access to resources needed to do so.
Should have access to the same and only the same healthcare resources as men (other services should be available, but billed additionally on an individual basis).
Should not be allowed to make decisions about their bodies that could prevent or terminate pregnancy.

Exists.
Never existed.
Existed before but was fixed.

suggests the climate is warming, but can't determine exactly why.
shows a natural and expected pattern of warming and cooling.
does not in any way prove or disprove global climate change.

7. The right to determine and express one's own gender identity:
is fundamental and should be respected, protected and embraced by others.
is up to the individual, but protecting it shouldn't be a priority for lawmakers.
goes against biology and is therefore wrong.

8. If an individual lives in poverty, it's because:
s/he's lazy.
of a complex web of circumstances, some of which are in her control and some of which aren't.
the American Dream of social mobility is a fallacy.
None of the above come close to describing my views.

9. Labor Unions:
protect worker's rights to safe conditions and access to fair pay.
limit companies' ability to be efficient and productive.
serve a purpose, but are often corrupt.
None of the above come close to describing my views.
